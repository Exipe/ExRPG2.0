Alpha Test
---
The alpha test is now live.
The alpha exists to discover as many bugs as possible, before a public release.
Any early feedback you give is also very much appreciated.
Please reports bugs and give suggestions in the appropriate channels in the Discord server.
Do note that any progress you make during alpha will be wiped.
Anyway, have fun!
